READ_1ST.TXT --  XTAL Version 5 Regression Package.
                 Description of files in package


     This package consists of a main directory with all the files
necessary for running XTAL on Sun Sparcstations.  There is no
executable code included for any platform other than this.  There are
five subdirectories containing the source code for each of the five
executable program modules that comprise the XTAL package.  The
contents of these subdirectories is only necessary if the user intends
to recompile these modules.

Files in main directory that are needed to run XTAL:
(1)  READ_1ST.TXT    ------  This file (ASCII)
(2)  xtal_doc.txt    ------  XTAL User's Manual (ASCII)
(3)  xtal            ------  Main program (Sun executable)
(4)  xpp             ------  Projection Pursuit Subprogram (Sun executable)
(5)  xmars           ------  Mars Subprogram (Sun executable)
(6)  bctm            ------  CTM Subprogram (Sun executable)
(7)  neural          ------  ANN Subprogram (Sun executable)


Subdirectories with source code needed for recompiling XTAL:
(1) XTAL_V51-------  C++ source code for xtal.
(2) PPR     -------  Fortran source code for xpp
(3) MARS    -------  Fortran source code for xmars
(4) CTM     -------  C++ source code for bctm
(5) ANN     -------  C++ source code for neural

To run on linux:
	You can try and run the package as it is since the binaries in this dir are compiled for linux (Mandrake10.0).  If it doesn't work, you will need to recompile.  You will need gcc, g++, and g77 to recompile the packages.  Follow the directions below to recompile:

To compile package for linux:
First, delete all the existing binary files:
rm xpp
rm bctm
rm neural
rm xmars
rm xtal

Now, compile all the separate packages:

1.  ANN
Go into the ANN directory.  Type:
make
This should create the "neural" binary file.  Check to see if it is there.  If it is, copy it to the xtal dir with command:
cp neural ../.

2.  CTM
Go into the CTM directory.  Type:
make
This should create the "bctm" binary file.  Check to see if it is there.  If it is, copy it to the xtal dir with command:
cp bctm ../.

3.  MARS
Go into the MARS directory.  Type:
g77 -g -o xmars mars_dvr3.f marslib.f -ff77 -fno-globals -Wno-globals
This should create the "xmars" binary file.  Check to see if it is there.  If it is, copy it to the xtal dir with command:
cp xmars ../.

4.  PPR
Go into the PPR directory.  Type:
g77 -o xpp ppprog.f ppr_dvr3.f 
This should create the "xpp" binary file.  Check to see if it is there.  If it is, copy it to the xtal dir with command:
cp xpp ../.

5.  XTAL
Go into the XTAL_V51 directory.  Type:
gcc -o xtal xta_v51.c -lm
This should create the "xtal" binary file.  Check to see if it is there.  If it is, copy it to the xtal dir with command:
cpp xtal ../.

Read the rest of the instructions on setting up the input files. Everything should work now.
