PP Driver

To compile, use

f77 -o xpp ppprog.f ppr_dvr3.f

The executable will be called xpp.

The following files contain the projection pursuit
driver and routines.  The driver is a short fortran program
which looks in the file pp.config for its input and then
runs the projection pursuit routines.  In order to communicate
to the program, you need to enter the information into the file
pp.config.  The format of this file is as follows:
--------------------------------------
train_filename
n      (number of samples in training set)
p      (number of predictor variables)
test_filename
nt     (number of samples in test set)
ml     ( projection pursuit parameter -see SMART manual)
mu     (projection pursuit parameter -see SMART manual)
out_filename
----------------------------------------
In the above example, replace the variables with numbers.
For example:
----------------------------------------
train.data
100
2
test.data
75
10
2
results1
-----------------------------------------
