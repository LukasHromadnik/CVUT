% Interface to the XTAL regression package.
%
%
%  xtal           interface to the XTAL regression package. 
%  xtal_rootdir   returns root directory of the XTAL package.
%  xtal_test      this script tests functionality of the XTAL interface.
%
%  
%  Requirements:
%   1. XTAL package is installed. XTAL can be downloaded from
%      http://www.ece.umn.edu/users/cherkass/ee8591/software/xtal.html
%      
%      The STPRtool comes with binaries compiled for Linux and Windows 
%      (to run XTAL under Windows it is required that CYGWIN from www.cygwin.com/ 
%      is installed).
%
%   2. XTAL root directory and the command line to run XTAL are specified 
%      in "xtal_rootdir.m". See "help xtal_rootdir".
%
%      For Linux and Windows the XTAL root directory and the command line are 
%      generated automatically. Hence the XTAL interface should work out of the box.  
%      If not you have to do both above mentioned steps manually.
