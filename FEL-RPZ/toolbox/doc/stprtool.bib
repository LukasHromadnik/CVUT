                  Statistical Pattern Recognition Toolbox (abbreviated
                  STPRtool). The STPRtool is a collection of pattern
                  recognition (PR) methods implemented in Matlab. The core of
                  the STPRtool is comprised of statistical PR algorithms
                  described in the monograph {\sl Schlesinger, M.I.,
                  Hlav\'a\v{c}, V: Ten Lectures on Statistical and Structural
                  Pattern Recognition, Kluwer Academic Publishers, 2002}. We
                  tried to create concise and complete documentation of the
                  STPRtool. This document and associated help files in {\sl
                  .html} should give all information and parameters the user
                  needs when she/he likes to call appropriate method
                  (typically a Matlab {\sl m-file}). The intention was not to
                  write another textbook. If the user does not know the method
                  then she/he will likely have to read the description of the
                  method in a referenced original paper or in a textbook. },
