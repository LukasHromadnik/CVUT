
Welcome
-------
 In order to use this Python interface for implementing and testing various ILP method, you need to have installed following SW:
    Java 8 JDK or higher
    Python 3.6 or higher
    Python's package PyJNIus
 See following sections for installing the required SWs; read all first, thereafter select suitable path.
 See minlog notebook for basic operation with FOL elements in this library. Most of the code is type hinted, even variables, therefore usage of a friendly IDE with type/method whispering, which can really simplify the work, is heavily recommended :) Also, most of the classes, e.g. Clause, have implemented iterator over their elements, so one can iterate over literals of a clause by calling 'for l in clause'; this also holds for arguments of an atom, literal, etc.

 
Installing Required SWs
--------------------
 The general idea is follows:
    1) install Java 8
    2) properly set PATH so that PyJNIus sees JVM server
    3) install python 3.6
       * if you don't use conda, you may install one from https://www.anaconda.com/download/
       * if you use conda then it is sufficient to run following command in cmd/terminal
            conda create -n py36 python=3.6
         by that, you create a new environment called py36, to run Python under its installation run following command in cmd/terminal
            activate py36
         however, this may differ according to conda version, or try
            source activate py36
    4) install Cython, e.g.
            pip install cython
    5) install PyJNIus by running following command in cmd/terminal
            pip install pyjnius
    6) install pandas, e.g.
            pip install pandas

    Tested with Java 8 and 9, Cython 0.25.2 and 0.27.1, Python 3.6

	
 Labs Computers
 --------------
    add following lines to file ~/.bashrc
        export JAVA_HOME="/opt/jdk1.8.0_144"
        export PATH="$JAVA_HOME/bin:$PATH"
    install conda if you haven't done it before, see https://cw.fel.cvut.cz/b172/courses/smu/tutorials/tutorial1
        wget https://repo.continuum.io/miniconda/Miniconda3-latest-Linux-x86_64.sh
        bash Miniconda3-latest-Linux-x86_64.sh
     create environment with Python 3.6
        conda create -n py36 python=3.6
     activate the environment
        source activate py36
     install Cython
        pip install cython
     install PyJNIus
        pip install pyjnius

		
 Installing Java
 ---------------
    Download proper installation package, e.g. see http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/index.html and follow instruction.
    Thereafter add path JDK_PATH\jre\bin\server to PATH system variable and set JAVA_HOME to path where JDK is installed.
        Windows -> see System variables
        Linux -> e.g. by terminal command
            export PATH=~/JDK_PATH/jre/bin/server:$PATH
            export JAVA_HOME=/.../jdk1.8.0_.../
    Check up whether a path to the right Java is set up, e.g. 'java -version' should give you something like "java version '1.8.0_...'" or higher.

	
 Linux
 -----
    In case of the error while importing pyjnius ".../sever/libjvm.so: cannot open shared object file: No such file or directory", create a symlink, e.g.
        # mkdir which is wanted, then move to it, then
        sudo ln -s /usr/lib/jvm/java..../lib/server/libjvm.so libjvm.so
        # i.e. ln -s /path/to/file /path/to/symlink
